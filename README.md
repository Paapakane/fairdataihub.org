## Project setup

```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
yarn serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

Use this step to build a local production version of the site. Use `serve` to preview the local build.

```
yarn build
npx serve -s dist
```

Note: You will not need to do anything to the hosted site. Continuous Delivery has been setup with Vercel. All you need to do is push your commit and wait for it to deploy.

### Lints and fixes files

```
yarn lint
```

A special thank you to Vercel for hosting this website.
