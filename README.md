## Project setup

Make sure to install the dependencies.

```bash

```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

Use this step to build a local production version of the site. Use `start` to preview the local build.

```bash
yarn build
yarn start
```

We recommend to look at the [documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org).

Note: You will not need to do anything to the hosted site. Continuous Delivery has been setup with Vercel. All you need to do is push your commit and wait for it to deploy.

A special thank you to Vercel for hosting this website.
