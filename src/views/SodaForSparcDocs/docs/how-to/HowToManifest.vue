          conveniently. We explain here how it must be structured according to
          the SPARC rules in order to provide some insight about the structure
          of the file generated by SODA.

      <ul class="docs-ul list-outside list-disc">
        <li>
          Format: the manifest file is accepted in either xlsx, csv, or json
          format. SODA generates it in the xlsx format based on the template
          provided by the Curation Team. A screenshot of a sample manifest file
          from a primary folder is provided below:
        </li>

        <div class="img-parent-div">
          <img
            src="https://github.com/fairdataihub/SODA-for-SPARC/blob/main/docs/documentation/How%20to/manifest/manifest-example.PNG?raw=true"
          />
        </div>

        <li>
          Location in the dataset: a manifest file is required in either
          <ul class="docs-ul list-outside list-decimal">
            <li>each of the high-level SPARC folders</li>
            or
            <li>in each of the dataset folders with at least one file.</li>
          </ul>
          SODA follows the structure #1 when generating the manifest files
          automatically for you. We thus only talk about structure #1 below.
          Should be 'None' if no extension (instead of blank).
        </li>

        <li>
          Content: The "filename" and "timestamp" fields are mandatory and it is
          suggested to provide other fields as needed to understand each file.
        </li>

        <ul class="docs-ul list-outside list-disc">
          <li>
            Filename: This should be path to the files relative to the
            high-level SPARC folder where the manifest file is located (with a
            forward slash independently of the OS). Note that the extension of
            the file is included.
          </li>

          <li>
            Timestamp: The last time the file was modified locally on the
            creator's computer, preferably in
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601"
              target="_blank"

            with UTC offset. For example, this would be
            "2019-07-13T02:43:14+05:30" for a file last modified on July 13th
            2019 at 2:43 AM (14 seconds) in PST (thus +5:30 to show the offset
            from UTC). If this timestamp is not available, the Pennsieve's
            timestamp (which indicate the last time the file was modified on
            Pennsieve) could be used as an alternative.
          </li>

          <li>
            File type: Type of this file. Would be '.jpg' or 'Image file' for
            the file histology.jpg.
