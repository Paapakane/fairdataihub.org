          conveniently. While SODA automatically generates the file in the
          required structure, we explain here how it must be structured
          according to the SPARC rules in order to provide some insight about
          the structure of the file generated by SODA.

      <ul class="docs-ul list-outside list-disc">
        <li>
          Format: The dataset description file is accepted in either xlsx, csv,
          or json format. SODA generates it in the xlsx format based on the
          template provided by the Curation Team.
        </li>

        <li>
          Location in the dataset: The dataset_description file must be included
          in the high-level dataset folder.
        </li>

        <li>
          Content: The "Metadata element" and "Value" columns are mandatory as
          well as the "Definition" and "Example" columns, which should remain
          unchanged. Some of the "Metadata element" are mandatory (highlighted
          in bold below) for all datasets and must be provided at least one
          "Value". If more than one "Value" is to be provided (for instance
          multiple "Contributors") for a "Metadata Item", each subsequent value
          column must be named "Value 2", "Value 3", "Value 4", and so forth.

          <ul class="docs-ul list-outside list-disc">
            <li>
              <strong>Name</strong>: Descriptive title for the dataset. This
              field should match exactly with your dataset name on Pennsieve.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Description</strong>: Brief description of the study and
              the data set. Equivalent to the abstract of a scientific paper.
              This could match the subtitle provided on Pennsieve.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Keywords</strong>: A set of 3-5 keywords other than
              already mentioned in the above elements that will aid in search of
              your dataset once published on the SPARC portal. Each keyword must
              be provided in a separate column.

            <li>
              <strong>Contributors</strong>: Name of any contributors to the
              dataset. These individuals need not have been authors on any
              publications describing the data, but should be acknowledged for
              their role in producing and publishing the dataset. If more than
              one, add each contributor in a new column. For each contributor it
              is mandatory at least one affiliation, at least one role, and role
              as contact person.

              as "Yes" in the "Is Contact Person" element of the "Metadata Item"
              (this is done automatically in SODA). If more than one role is to
